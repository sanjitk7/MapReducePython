unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.

  "I tell you," said Jerry, "that you buried paving-stones and earth
in that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was
a take in. Me and two more knows it."

  "How do you know it?"

  "What's that to you? Ecod!" growled Mr. Cruncher, "it's you I have
got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon
tradesmen! I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea."

  Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.

  "At another time, sir," he returned, evasively, "the present time is
illconwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he knows
well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he
was, in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch
hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;" Mr. Cruncher
dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; "or I'll out and announce
him."

  "Humph! I see one thing," said Carton. "I hold another card, Mr.
Barsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the
air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication
with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself,
who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and
come to life again! A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against
the Republic. A strong card- a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?"

  "No!" returned the spy. "I throw up. I confess that we were so
unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England
at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted
up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that
sham. Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of
wonders to me."

  "Never you trouble your head about this man," retorted the
contentious Mr. Cruncher; "you'll have trouble enough with giving your
attention to that gentleman. And look here! Once more!"- Mr.
Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious
parade of his liberality- "I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you
for half a guinea."

  The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,
with more decision, "It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in
my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better
trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent.
In short, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are
all desperate here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper,
and I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. Now,
what do you want with me?"

  "Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?"

  "I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape
possible," said the spy, firmly.

  "Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at
the Conciergerie?"

  "I am sometimes."

  "You can be when you choose?"

  "I can pass in and out when I choose."

  Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent,
he said, rising:

  "So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well
that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and
me. Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word
alone."

  IX

  THE GAME MADE

  WHILE SYDNEY CARTON and the Sheep of the prisons were in the
adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr.
Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That
honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire
confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he
had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his
finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and
whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar
kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is
seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect
openness of character.

  "Jerry," said Mr. Lorry. "Come here."

  Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in
advance of him.

  "What have you been, besides a messenger?"

  After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his
patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying,
"Agricultooral character."

  "My mind misgives me much," said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a
forefinger at him, "that you have used the respectable and great house
of Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful
occupation of an infamous description. If you have, don't expect me to
befriend you when you get back to England. If you have, don't expect
me to keep your secret. Tellson's shall not be imposed upon."

  "I hope, sir," pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, "that a gentleman
like yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey
at it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so- I
don't say it is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into
account that if it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side.
There'd be two sides to it. There might be medical doctors at the
present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman
don't pick up his fardens- fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens- half
fardens! no, nor yet his quarter- a banking away like smoke at
Tellson's, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the
sly, a going in and going out to their own carriages- ah! equally like
smoke, if not more so. Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on
Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander. And
here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and
would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin' again the business to
that degree as is ruinating-stark ruinating! Whereas them medical
doctors' wives don't flop- catch 'em at it! Or, if they flop, their
floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly
have one without t'other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with
parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen
(all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get much by it, even if
it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him,
Mr. Lorry. He'd never have no good of it; he'd want all along to be
out of the line, if he could see his way but, being once in- even if
it wos so."

  "Ugh!" cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless. "I am
shocked at the sight of you."

  "Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir," pursued Mr.
Cruncher, "even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--"

  "Don't prevaricate," said Mr. Lorry.

  "No, I will not, sir," returned Mr. Cruncher, as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice- "which I don't say it is- wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there
stool, at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up
and growed up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you,
general-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if
such should be your wishes. If it wos so, which I still don't say it
is (for I will not prevaricate to you, sir), let that there boy keep
his father's place, and take care of his mother; don't blow upon
that boy's father- do not do it, sir- and let that father go into
the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends for what he would
have undug- if it wos so- by diggin' of 'em in with a will, and with
conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe. That, Mr.
Lorry," said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an
announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse,
"is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't see all
this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects
without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of
things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of
you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the
good cause when I might have kep' it back."

  "That at least is true," said Mr. Lorry. "Say no more now. It may be
that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action- not in words. I want no more words."

  Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. "Adieu, Mr. Barsad," said the former; our
arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me."

  He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When
they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?

  "Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured
access to him once."

  Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.

  "It is all I could do," said Carton. "To propose too much, would
be to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said,
nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was
obviously the weakness of the position. There is no help for it."

  "But access to him," said Mr. Lorry, "if it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him."

  "I never said it would."

  Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest,
gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety
of late, and his tears fell.

  "You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in an altered
voice. "Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not
see my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your
sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
however."

  Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner,
there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his
touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him,
was wholly unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently
pressed it.

  "To return to to poor Darnay," said Carton. "Don't tell Her of
this interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go
to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to
convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence."

  Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton
to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the
look, and evidently understood it.

  "She might think a thousand things," Carton said, "and any of them
would only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said
to you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my
hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can
find to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be
very desolate to-night."

  "I am going now, directly."

  "I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and
reliance on you. How does she look?"

  "Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful."

  "Ah!"

  It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh- almost like a sob. It
attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said
which), passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a
hill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one
of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the
white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the
fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his
long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His
indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of
remonstrance from Mr. Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of
the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot.

  "I forgot it," he said.

  Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of
the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and
having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was
strongly reminded of that expression.

  "And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?" said Carton,
turning to him.

  "Yes. As I was telling you last night when ucie came in so
unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to
have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I
have my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go."

  They were both silent.

  "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?" said Carton,
wistfully.

  "I am in my seventy-eighth year."

  "You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly
occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?"

  "I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man.
Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy."

  "See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will
miss you when you leave it empty!"

  "A solitary old bachelor," answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head.
"There is nobody to weep for me."

  "How can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her
child?"

  "Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said."

  "It is a thing to thank God for; is it not?"

  "Surely, surely."

  "If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or
respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in
no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered
by!' your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses;
would they not?"

  "You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be."

  Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence
of a few moments, said:

  "I should like to ask you:- Does your childhood seem far off? Do the
days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?"

  Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:

  "Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and
nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so
old!), and by many associations of the days when what we call the
World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in
me."

  "I understand the feeling!" exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush.
"And you are the better for it?"

  "I hope so."

  Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on
with his outer coat; "But you," said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the
theme, "you are young."

  "Yes," said Carton. "I am not old, but my young way was never the
way to age. Enough of me."

  "And of me, I am sure," said Mr. Lorry. "Are you going out?"

  "I'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be
uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court
to-morrow?"

  "Yes, unhappily."

  "I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find
a place for me. Take my arm, sir."

  Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the
streets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton
left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back
to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of
her going to the prison every day. "She came out here," he said,
looking about him, "turned this way, must have trod on these stones
often. Let me follow in her steps."

  It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La
Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer,
having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.

  "Good night, citizen," said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for,
the man eyed him inquisitively.

  "Good night, citizen."

  "How goes the Republic?"

  "You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall
mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of
being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a
Barber!"

  "Do you often go to see him--"

  "Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at
work?"

  "Never."

  "Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes!
Less than two pipes. Word of honour!"

  As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to
explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a
rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.

  "But you are not English," said the wood-sawyer, "though you wear
English dress?"

  "Yes," said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.

  "You speak like a Frenchman."

  "I am an old student here."

  "Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman."

  "Good night, citizen."

  "But go and see that droll dog," the little man persisted, calling
after him. "And take a pipe with you!"

  Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the
middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his
pencil on a scrap of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step
of one who remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets-
much dirtier than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained
uncleansed in those times of terror-he stopped at a chemist's shop,
which the owner was closing with his own hands. A small, dim,
crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small,
dim, crooked man.

  Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. "Whew!" the chemist
whistled softly, as he read it. "Hi! hi! hi!"

  Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:

  "For you, citizen?"

  "For me."

  "You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
consequences of mixing them?"

  "Perfectly."

  Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one
by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for
them, and deliberately left the shop. "There is nothing more to do,"
said he, glancing upward at the moon, "until to-morrow. I can't
sleep."

  It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these
words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more
expressive of negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a
tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at
length struck into his road and saw its end.

  Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors
as a youth of great promise, he had his father to the grave. His
mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been read
at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark
streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him. "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the
Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."

  In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural
sorrow rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put
to death, and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in
the prisons, and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of
association that brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's
anchor from the deep, might have been easily found. He did not seek
it, but repeated them and went on.

  With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people
were going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the
horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no
prayers were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that
length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors,
plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved,
as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding
gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death
which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of
a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working
of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the whole life and
death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury;
Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.

  Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on
heavy shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled,
and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting
home. At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a
mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud. He
carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his
neck asked her for a kiss.

  "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever
liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."

  Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm
and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but,
he heard them always.

  The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to
the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where
the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in
the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face
out of the sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned
pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were
delivered over to Death's dominion.

  But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that
burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright
rays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of
light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the
river sparkled under it.

  The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a
congenial friend, in the morning stillness He walked by the stream,
far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell
asleep on the bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered
there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned
purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the
sea.- "Like me!"

  A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf,
then glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its
silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up
out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor
blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, "I am the resurrection and
the life."

  Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to
surmise where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing
but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to
refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.

  The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep- whom
many fell away from in dread- pressed him into an obscure corner among
the crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She
was there, sitting beside her father.

  When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy
blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney
Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.

  Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of
procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing.
There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and
ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the
suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the
winds.

  Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and
good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and
the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a
craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips,
whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A
life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques
Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empanelled
to try the deer.

  Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public
prosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell,
uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then
sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and
heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained
attention.

  Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused
and retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night.
Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a
family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used
their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription,
absolutely Dead in Law.

  To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.

  The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?

  "Openly, President."

  "By whom?"

  "Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine."

  "Good.

 "Therese Defarge, his wife."

  "Good."

  "Alexandre Manette, physician."

  A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it,
Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had
been seated.

  "President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery
and a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life.
Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the
husband of my child!"

  "Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the
authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to
what is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good
citizen as the Republic."

  Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell,
and with warmth resumed.

  "If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what
is to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!"

  Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down,
with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter
drew closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands
together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth.

  Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of
his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the
imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's
service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when
released and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for
the court was quick with its work.

  "You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?"

  "I believe so."

  Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: "You were one of
the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day
there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress
when it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!"

  It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the
audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his
bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, "I
defy that bell!" wherein she was likewise much commended.

  "Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
citizen."

  "I knew," said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at
him; "I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in
a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from
himself. He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five,
North Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun
that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that
cell. It falls. I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is
one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler. I examine it, very closely.
In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and
replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have
made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor
Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this
paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the
President."

  "Let it be read."

  In a dead silence and stillness- the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge
never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes
there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them- the paper was
read, as follows.

  X

  THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SHADOW

  "I, ALEXANDRE MANETTE, Unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais,
and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my
doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767.
I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to
secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and
laboriously made a place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand
may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.

  "These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write
with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney,
mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.
Hope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible
warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain
unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the
possession of my right mind- that my memory is exact and
circumstantial- and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these
my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at
the Eternal Judgment-seat.

  "One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I
think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was
walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment
of the frosty air, at an hour's distance from my place of residence in
the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along
behind me, driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage
pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put
out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.

  "The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his
horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The
carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had
time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. I
observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner,
voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.

  "'You are Doctor Manette?' said one.

  "'I am.'

  "'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the
young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last
year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?'

  "'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you
speak so graciously.'

  "'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being so
fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of
overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?'

  "The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these
words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the
carriage door. They were armed. I was not.

  "'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does
me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the
case to which I am summoned.'

  "The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doctor,
your clients are, people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to
enter the carriage?'

  "I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They
both entered after me- the last springing in, after putting up the
steps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.

  "I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no
doubt that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything
exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from
the task. Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave
off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place. * * * *

  "The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
Barrier- I did not estimate the distance at that time, but
afterwards when I traversed it- it struck out of the main avenue,
and presently stopped at a solitary house. We all three alighted,
and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected
fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened
immediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two
conductors struck the man who opened it, with his heavy riding
glove, across the face.

  "There was nothing in this action to attract my particular
attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than
dogs. But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the
man in like manner with his arm; the look and bearing of the
brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived
them to be twin brothers.

  "From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and
had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I
was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the
brain, lying on a bed.

  "The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not
much past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were
bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these
bonds were all portions of a gentleman's dress. On one of them,
which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the
armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.

  "I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the
patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her
face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her
mouth, and was in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out
my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the
embroidery in the corner caught my sight.

  "I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm
her and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated
and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated
the words, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted
up to twelve, and said, 'Hush!' For an instant, and no more, she would
pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again,
and she would repeat the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!'
and would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush!' There was no
variation in the order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the
regular moment's pause, in the utterance of these sounds.

  "'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?'

  "To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It
was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.'

  "'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?'

  "'A brother.'

  "'I do not address her brother?'

  "He answered with great contempt, 'No.'

  "'She has some recent association with the number twelve?'

  "The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock?'

  "'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast,
'how useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was
coming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be
lost. There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.'

  "The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There
is a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it
on the table. * * * *

  "I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to
my lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines
that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any
of those.

  "'Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.

  "'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no
more.

  "I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it
after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I
then sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed
woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated
into a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently
furnished- evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some
thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden
the sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their
regular succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my
brother!' the counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!' The frenzy was so
violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the
arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful.
The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon
the sufferer's breast had this much soothing influence, that for
minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. It had no effect upon
the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.

  "For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat
by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking
on, before the elder said:

  "'There is another patient.'

  "I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case?'

  "'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a
light. * * * *

  "The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase,
which was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered
ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the
tiled roof, and there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored
in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of
apples in sand. I had to pass through that part, to get at the
other. My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. I try it with these
details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the
close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.

  "On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head,
lay a handsome peasant boy- a boy of not more than seventeen at the
most. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand
clenched on his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight
upward. I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one
knee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a
sharp point.

  "'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. 'Let me examine it.'

  "'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.'

  "It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand
away. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to
twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it
had been looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I
turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this
handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded
bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.

  "'How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.

  "'A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw
upon him, and has fallen by my brother's sword- like a gentleman.'

  "There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient
to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it
would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine
of his vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate
feeling about the boy, or about his fate.

  "The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they
now slowly moved to me.

  "'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs
are proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill
us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. She- have you seen
her, Doctor?'

  "The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.

  "I said, 'I have seen her.'

  "'She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights,
these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years,
but we have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my
father say so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good
young man, too: a tenant of his. We were all tenants of his- that
man's who stands there. The other is his brother, the worst of a bad
race.'

  "It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily
force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.

  "'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common
dogs are by those superior Beings- taxed by him without mercy, obliged
to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill,
obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and
forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pinaged
and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of
meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed,
that his people should not see it and take it from us- I say, we
were so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father
told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and
that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren
and our miserable race die out!'

  "I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting
forth like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the
dying boy.

  "'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that
time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend
and comfort him in our cottage- our dog-hut, as that man would call
it. She had not been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw
her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him- for what
are husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good
and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.
What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence
with her, to make her willing?'

  "The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to
the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true.
The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see,
even in this Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference;
the peasant's, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.

  "'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him
and drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in
their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble
sleep may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists
at night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was
not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed- if
he could find food- he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of
the bell, and died on her bosom.'

  "Nothing human could have beld life in the boy but his determination
to tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of
death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to
cover his wound.

  "'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his
brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told
his brother- and what that is, will not be long unknown to you,
Doctor, if it is now- his brother took her away- for his pleasure
and diversion, for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When
I took the tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke
one of the words that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have
another) to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least,
she will never be his vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and
last night climbed in- a common dog, but sword in hand.- Where is
the loft window? It was somewhere here?'

  "The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around
him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were
trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.

  "'She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he
was dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then
struck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him
as to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the
sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself-
thrust at me with all his skill for his life.'

  "My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of
a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman's. In
another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.

  "'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?'

  "'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that
he referred to the brother.

  "'He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is
the man who was here? Turn my face to him.'

  "I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested for
the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely:
obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.

  "'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide,
and his right hand raised, 'in the days when all these things are to
be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race,
to answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign
that I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered
for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for
them separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I
do it.'

  "Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid
him down dead. * * * *

  "When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her
raving in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this
might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the
silence of the grave.

  "I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side
of the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the
piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or
the order of her words. They were always 'My husband, my father, and
my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve. Hush!'

  "This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her.
I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she
began to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that
opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the
dead.

  "It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist
me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then
that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first
expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I
lost the little hope I had had of her.

  "'Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.

  "'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.'

  "'What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking
down at her with some curiosity.

  "'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and
despair.'

  "He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved
a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said
in a subdued voice,

  "'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds,
I recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is
high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are
probably mindful of your interest. Ile things that you see here, are
things to be seen, and not spoken of.'

  "I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.

  "'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'

  "'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of
patients are always received in confidence.' I was guarded in my
answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.

  "Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me. * * * *

  "I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and
total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no
confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail,
every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.

  "She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand
some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her
lips. She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I
told her. It was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She
faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the
boy had done.

  "I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told
the brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day.
Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save
the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat
behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when
it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might
hold with her; as if- the thought passed through my mind- I were dying
too.

  "I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and
that peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the
mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly
degrading to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught
the younger brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he
disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was
smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I
also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.

  "My patient died, two hours before midnight- at a time, by my watch,
answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was
alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one
side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.

  "The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to
ride away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their
boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.

  "'At last she is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.

  "'She is dead,' said I.

  "'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned
round.

  "He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He
now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on
the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
nothing.

  "'Pray excuse me,' said I. 'Under the circumstances, no.'

  "They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine
to them, and we parted without another word on either side. * * * *

  "I am weary, weary, weary- worn down by misery. I cannot read what I
have written with this gaunt hand.

  "Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in
a little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had
anxiously considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write
privately to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to
which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in
effect, stating all the circumstances. I knew what Court influence
was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that
the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own
mind. I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife;
and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension
whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be
danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the
knowledge that I possessed.

  "I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter
that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish
it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me
just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to
see me. * * * *

   "I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set
myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the
gloom upon me is so dreadful.

  "The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long
life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the
wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which
the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter
embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the
conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.

  "My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and
I know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part
suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel
story, of her husband's share in it, and my being resorted to. She did
not know that the girl was dead. Her hope had been, she said in
great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman's sympathy. Her hope
had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long
been hateful to the suffering many.

  "She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living,
and her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her
nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing.
Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the
hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to
this wretched hour I am ignorant of both. * * * *

  "These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a
warning, yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.

  "She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her
marriage. How could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her,
and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him,
and in dread of her husband too. When I handed her down to the door,
there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her
carriage.

  "'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I
would do all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never
prosper in his inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no
other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required
of him. What I have left to call my own- it is little beyond the worth
of a few jewels-I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow,
with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this
injured family, if the sister can be discovered.'

  "She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own
dear sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child
answered her bravely, 'Yes!' I kissed her hand, and she took him in
her arms, and went away caressing him. I never saw her more.

  "As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew
it, I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and,
not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.

  "That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man
in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly
followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my
servant came into the room where I sat with my wife- O my wife,
beloved of my heart! My fair young English wife!- we saw the man,
who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.

  "An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not
detain me, he had a coach in waiting.

  "It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear
of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from
behind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road
from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The
Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me,
burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the
ashes with his foot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I
was brought to my living grave.

  "If it had pleased GOD to put it in the hard heart of either of
the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife- so much as to let me know by a word whether alive
or dead- I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them.
But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them,
and that they have no part in His mercies. And them and their
descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette,
unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my
unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be
answered for. I denounce them to Heaven and to earth."

  A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the
time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped
before it.

  Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other
captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it,
biding their time. Little need to show that this detested family
name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought
into the fatal register. The man never trod ground whose virtues and
services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such
denunciation.

  And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a
well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife.
One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and
self-immolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President
said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the
good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the
Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and
would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a
widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic
fervour, not a touch of human sympathy.

  "Much influence around him, has that Doctor?" murmured Madame
Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. "Save him now, my Doctor, save
him!"

  At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar
and roar.

  Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy
of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!

  DUSK

  THE WRETCHED WIFE of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered
no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it
was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not
augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.

  The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of
doors, the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the
court's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie
stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her
face but love and consolation.

  "If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good
citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!"

  There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who
had taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to
the show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, "Let her embrace
him then; it is but a moment." It was silently acquiesced in, and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he,
by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.

  "Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my
love. We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!"

  They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.

  "I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don't
suffer for me. A parting blessing for our child."

  "I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her
by you."

  "My husband. No! A moment!" He was tearing himself apart from her.
"We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my
heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I
leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me."

  Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to
both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:

  "No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should
kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know,
now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you
knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and
conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and
all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!"

  Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white
hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.

  "It could not be otherwise," said the prisoner. "All things have
worked together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain
endeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my
fatal presence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier
end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and
forgive me. Heaven bless you!"

  As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after
him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a
comforting smile. As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned,
laid her head lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to
him, and fell at his feet.

  Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were
with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity- that had a
flush of pride in it.

  "Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight."

  He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in
a coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took
his seat beside the driver.

  When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough
stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and
carried her up rhe staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down
on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.

  "Don't recall her to herself," he said, softly, to the latter,
"she is better so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only
faints."

  "Oh, Carton, Carton, Carton!" cried little Lucie, springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. "Now
that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma,
something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all
the people who love her, bear to see her so?"

  He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his
face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious
mother.

  "Before I go," he said, and paused- "I may kiss her?"

  It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched
her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was
nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren
when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, "A life
you love."

  When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr.
Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:

  "You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at
least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very
friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?"

  "Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did." He returned
the answer in great trouble, and very slowly.

  "Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon
are few and short, but try."

  "I intend to try. I will not rest a moment."

  "That's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things
before now- though never," he added, with a smile and a sigh together,
"such great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when
we misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay
down if it were not."

  "I will go," said Doctor Manette, "to the Prosecutor and the
President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to
name. I will write too, and- But stay! There is a celebration in the
streets, and no one will be accessible until dark."

  "That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much
the forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how
you speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have
seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?"

  "Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
this."

  "It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If
I go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either
from our friend or from yourself?"

  "Yes."

  "May you prosper!"

  Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on
the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.

  "I have no hope," said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.

  "Nor have I."

  "If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to
spare him- which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or
any man's to them!- I doubt if they durst spare him after the
demonstration in the court."

  "And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound."

  Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon
it.

  "Don't despond," said Carton, very gently; "don't grieve. I
encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might
one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life
was wantonly thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her."

  "Yes, yes, yes," returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, "you are
right.

  But he will perish; there is no real hope."

  "Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope," echoed Carton. And
walked with a settled step, down-stairs.

  DARKNESS

  SYDNEY CARTON paused in the street, not quite decided where to go.
"At Tellson's banking-house at nine," he said, with a musing face.
"Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It
is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here;
it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But
care, care, Let me think it out!"

  Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he
took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the
thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression
was confirmed. "It is best," he said, finally resolved, "that these
people should know there is such a man as I here." And he turned his
face towards Saint Antoine.

  Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a
wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one
who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question.
Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer
streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound
asleep after dinner. For the first time in many years, he had no
strong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light
thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr.
Lorry's hearth like a man who had done with it.

  It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went
out into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint
Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and
slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and
his coat-collar, and his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to
Defarge's, and went in.

  There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of
the restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had
seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in
conversation with the Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted
in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.

  As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.

  He repeated what he had already said.

  "English?" asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows.

  After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word
were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former
strong foreign accent. "Yes, madame, yes. I am English!"

  Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning, he heard her say, "I swear to you, like Evremonde!"

  Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.

  "How?"

  "Good evening."

  "Oh! Good evening, citizen," filling his glass. "Ah! and good
wine. I drink to the Republic."

  Defarge went back to the counter, and said, "Certainly, a little
like." Madame sternly retorted, "I tell you a good deal like." Jacques
Three pacifically remarked, "He is so much in your mind, see you,
madame." The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, "Yes, my faith!
And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once
more to-morrow!"

  Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow
forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all
leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low.
After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards
him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin
editor, they resumed their conversation.

  "It is true what madame says," observed Jacques Three. "Why stop?
There is great force in that. Why stop?"

  "Well, well," reasoned Defarge, "but one must stop somewhere.
After all, the question is still where?"

  "At extermination," said madame.

  "Magnificent!" croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
approved.

  "Extermination is good doctrine, my wife," said Defarge, rather
troubled; "in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has
suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face
when the paper was read."

  "I have observed his face!" repeated madame, contemptuously and
angrily. "Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to
be not the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of
his face!"

  "And you have observed, my wife," said Defarge, in a deprecatory
manner, "the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish
to him!"

  "I have observed his daughter," repeated madame; "yes, I have
observed his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her
to-day, and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the
court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but
lift my finger--!" She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were
always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge
before her, as if the axe had dropped.

  "The citizeness is superb!" croaked the Juryman.

  "She is an Angel!" said The Vengeance, and embraced her.

  "As to thee," pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband,
"if it depended on thee- which, happily, it does not- thou wouldst
rescue this man even now."

  "No!" protested Defarge. "Not if to lift this glass would do it! But
I would leave the matter there. I say, stop there."

  "See you then, Jacques," said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; "and see
you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other
crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my
register, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband,
is that so."

  "It is so," assented Defarge, without being asked.

  "In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he
finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle
of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on
this spot, by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so."

  "It is so," assented Defarge.

  "That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the
lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and
between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate.
Ask him, is that so."

  "It is so," assented Defarge again.
